# DECASWAP AMM

DECASWAP allows users to add assets into pools and earn passive yield paid in USDC. There are single-sided Pool LPs, as well as a Global LP of all pools at the same time - the DECAPOOL. The system controls the virtual balances of the paired asset - D units; which cannot be bought or held directly.&#x20;

The LPs also earn DECA tokens. Pools use the Constant-Function AMM design. The system supports streaming swaps to be capital efficient, as well as limit orders - “price conditional swaps”. A router also has an in-built swap queue, and anyone can bump the swap queue and claim fees.&#x20;

An early-liquidation dynamic-interest lending scheme is supported with 50% LTV loans from pool collateral.&#x20;

There is a DECADAO with locked DECA tokens that earn 10% System Income and control protocol parameters.
