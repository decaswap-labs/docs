# Summary

DECASWAP AMM seems to be the first design that has pure single-sided UX with a passive USDC-earning fee experience. Streaming Swaps is what allows the system to stay competitive with CLAMM. If 15BPS is the target then a $10m swap on a $100m pool can be done in 67 blocks, which is 13 mins. Arbitrage and limit orders accelerates streaming speeds. A peer2pool lending scheme is also possible with the CFMM-based liquidity design since it can quote 0 to infinity and the borrowers both waive liquidity fees as well as pay an interest rate to LPs.
